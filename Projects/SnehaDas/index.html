    <p>ISIS is the latest iteration of faith-based violent extremism that have grown out of the rubble of the Syrian civil war and post-occupation Iraq. While social media has been used to launch revolutions against tyrannical regimes, it is also being used by groups such as ISIS to spread their message of hate, recruit susceptible youth, and project power all over the world.There is
	a need to fight against violent extremists at home and abroad. </p>

	<p style = "text-align: left">The November 2015 Paris attacks were a series of coordinated terrorist attacks that occurred on Friday 13 November 2015 in Paris, France and the city's northern suburb, Saint-Denis.</p> 
	<p>Beginning at 21:16 CET, three suicide bombers struck outside the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, during a football match, followed by several mass shootings, and a suicide bombing, at caf√©s and restaurants.</p>
	<p>ISIS claimed responsibility for these attacks, saying that it was retaliation for the French airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq.</p>
	<p> The chart portrays the number of tweets made by ISIS fanboys on Twitter during a 10 month period chosen during the time of these attacks, further highlighting the fact that the number of tweets made by them referring to this event shooted up post the attack!</p>
	
	<h1 style = "text-align:center; color: dark grey">Which clergy do pro-ISIS fanboys quote the most and which clergy do they hate the most?</h1>

	<p> A sentiment analysis was performed on 14,000 tweets made by ISIS fanboys, collected from January 2015 to May 2016. The analysis was performed on 10 Muslim clergy quoted in these tweets to derive conclusions on wich clergy was famous or infamous among these fanboys, based on a rank assigned (0 or 1). The following conclusions were achieved:</p>
	<p style = "color: lightgreen"> Clergy they like the most from tweets:</p><p> "Anwar Awlaki", "Ahmad Jibril", "Ibn Taymiyyah", "Abdul Wahhab", "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi". </p>
   <p style = "color: orangered">Clergy that they hate the most from tweets :</p> <p>"Hamza Yusuf", "Suhaib Webb", "Yaser Qadhi", "Nouman Ali Khan", "Yaqoubi".</p>
