        <p class="intro p">
            Legislators in Congress receive millions of dollars in 'contributions' from lobbies and organizations. House of Representatives alone received around <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=K02&cycle=2016&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U">$15 million</a> open donations in 2016 <i>for election only</i>. Question is, do lobby contributions affect voting on policies? We look for voting and donation patterns on 20 policies across Republican and Democrat Representatives for the 114th Congress (2015 to 2017).
            <br/><br/>The first graph shows how many Representatives voted in the same direction as their lobbyists and how many opposed their lobbyists. The second graph shows the average contributions a candidate in each group received. Across the 20 policies we see that Republicans receive significantly more donations than Democrats. The former also seem to vote more regularly in favor* of their lobbyist. Representatives who do not vote tend to receive the highest donations.
